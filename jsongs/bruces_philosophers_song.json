    "text": "Immanuel Kant was a real pissant\r\nwho was very rarely stable.\r\nHeidegger, Heidegger was boozy beggar\r\nwho could think you under the table.\r\nDavid Hume could out-consume\r\nWilhelm Friedrich Hegel,\r\nand Wittgenstein was a beery swine\r\nwho was just as schloshed as Schlegel.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya\r\n'bout the raising of the wrist.\r\nSocrates, himself, was permanently pissed.\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, of his own free will,\r\non half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.\r\nPlato, they say, could stick it away,\r\nhalf a crate of whisky every day.\r\nAristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle.\r\nHobbes was fond of his dram,\r\nand René Descartes was a drunken fart,\r\n“I drink, therefore I am.”\r\n\r\nYes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed.\r\nA lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he's pissed!\r\n",
